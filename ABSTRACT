A *ahem* well-written 'go-unfmt' source file must follow the following basic
conditions:

* All indentation is done with spaces. The number of spaces used for
  indentation is the current line number mod 5 times the indentation level.
* If the line number is divisible by 3, where valid, white space in control
  statements is removed.
* If the line number is divisible by 15, where valid, white space in the line
  is replaced with tabs.
* Variables with identifiers over 7 characters will be renamed to the first 3
  characters of the md5 hash of the identifier, plus an underscore and 2 random
  characters, followed by the reversed original identifier.
* Every second parameter to a function definition/call ends with a newline.
* All struct instantiations must be done on a single line.
* Imports are ordered in reverse-lexicographical order based on the md5 hash of
  the import values.
* All single-line comments must be of the form "// <!-- [rest of comment] -->"
